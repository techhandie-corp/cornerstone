            Cornerstone Community Development Corporation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit faith-based organization.
            Our programs are offered to community members at little or no cost. Therefore, we rely on the
            support and generosity of those individuals and organizations, like yourself, who are committed
            to community wellness. Any funding we receive goes directly to support our programs, i.e. they
            are not allocated to indirect or administrative costs. Your donations help provide the necessary 
            resources to produce sound effective programs.
