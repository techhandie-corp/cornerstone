                <h4>Matthew 25:34-40 (NIV) -</h4>
                <p><em>"Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance,
                the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world.  (35)  For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, 
                I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in,  (36)  I needed clothes and you
                clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.'  (37)  "Then the righteous will
                answer him, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?  (38)  When did we
                see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you?  (39)  When did we see you sick or in prison and 
                go to visit you?' (40)  "The King will reply, 'Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers 
                and sisters of mine, you did for me.'</em></p>
               <br>
                <h4>Luke 10:33-37 (NIV) -</h4>
                <p><em>But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him.  (34)  He went
                to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and 
                took care of him.  (35)  The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper. 'Look after him,' he said, 
                'and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.'  (36)  "Which of these three do you think 
                was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?"  (37)  The expert in the law replied, "The one who had 
                mercy on him." Jesus told him, "Go and do likewise."</em></p>
