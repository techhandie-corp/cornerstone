            As part of our commitment to the sustained growth and develop of community, we offer a three tier internship
            program that helps to train the community leaders of tomorrow. In light of the current political climate,
            we are uniquely equipped to help prepare and train this current generation in grass roots leadership and 
            community service. At Cornerstone, we have the collective knowledge and experience to address the need and 
            raise tomorrow's community leaders.

            Interns, operating in the tiers, will help move the Affinity Directory online, help with developing symposia,
            and better engage Cornerstone in the community. Interns are recruited to one of three tiers for their internship.
            They are assigned a mentor who would be responsible for oversight and development during their time with Cornerstone.
            Interns are given a monetary stipend (sponsor funded) as well as a letter of recommendation at the completion of the
            program. Students from an affiliated school may receive cooperative learning credits. The program is a type of 
            apprenticeship in developing grassroots organization skills.
