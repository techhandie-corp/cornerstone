            <span>OPERATION RE-BOOT</span> is a youth support and enhancement initiative that began as an independent
             summer program for middle to high school age community youth and has evolved into a partnership between
             Cornerstone Community Development Corporation, the community and the school system. Cornerstone works along 
             side the school system to help sponsor and support school based programs, as well as, develops and intro
             duces programs directly to the community. Community development is our passion and the youth are
             a vital integral part of any community. With so much negativity directed at todayâ€™s youth, we try to 
             accentuate the positive.

        <p>
            Our programs are youth activity driven designed to promote self-esteem and intrinsic value 
            with an understanding of relationship and community. They attempt to stimulate an interest in 
            society and the world environment, to create an understanding of one's fit in that environment,
            and to recognize the opportunity and capacity to contribute to it.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            The youth shape, explore, experience and in the process learn more about themselves, each 
            other, and the world around them. Our programs provide exposure and opportunities that broaden
            their interests and increase their awareness of possibilities outside of their current purview.
